/**
 * **VueComputedRef**
 *
 * The goal of this type is to _appear_ to the runtime and type systems
 * to be a `ComputedRef` (aka, **Computed** property).
 *
 * None of the functionality is provided by this but it allows us to create
 * _types_ and _type guards_ which can respond to this structure without
 * needing to have `Vue` but a dependency on this package.
