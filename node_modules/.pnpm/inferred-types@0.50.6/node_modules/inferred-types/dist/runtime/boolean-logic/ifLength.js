/**
 * **ifLength**(val,length, ifVal, elseVal)
 *
 * Runtime utility which tests whether the `value` passed in is both an array/tuple
 * and that it's length is equal to `length`. It then provides two callbacks with
 * narrowed types for these two conditions.
 *
 * @param value the value being tested
 * @param ifVal the value (strongly typed) returned if val is of appropriate length
 * @param elseVal the value (strongly typed) returned if val is NOT of given length
