 * **intersection**(a,b,[deref])

 * A set operation which provides the _intersection_ between
 * between two array's `a` and `b`.
 *
 * - when passing in arrays, you may also pass in a _dereferencing_ property
 * which will be used for arrays of objects (or sub-arrays) so that the comparison
 * is done on the dereferenced value versus the value as a whole.
